        <item>###Event notifications</item>

        <item>#No notifications appear</item>
        <item>The first step is to make sure that the setting \"Notification period\" has any period selected. After that try to select item \"Test notification\". If after all of the above, the notification still does not appear, then the matter is in the Android settings: either the \"Do not disturb\" mode is turned on, or all notifications are turned off in the notification manager, or the battery saving mode is turned on in the smartphone.</item>

        <item>#Multiple notifications per event</item>
        <item>Setting \"Notification period\" in the main application settings allows you to select several separate periods for notification of an event. For example, you can set up receiving notifications for the week and day of the event.</item>

        <li>contact found, but there is already data about the birthday - the date from the calendar will be added to the event (with or without a year - depending on the setting)
        <li>the contact was found, but there is no information about the birthday - a new event will be added to the list
