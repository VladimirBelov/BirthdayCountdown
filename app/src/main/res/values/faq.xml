        <item>###Event notifications</item>

        <item>#No notifications appear</item>
        <item>The first step is to make sure that the setting \"Notification period\" has any period selected. After that try to select item \"Test notification\". If after all of the above, the notification still does not appear, then the matter is in the Android settings: either the \"Do not disturb\" mode is turned on, or all notifications are turned off in the notification manager, or the battery saving mode is turned on in the smartphone.</item>

        <item>#Multiple notifications per event</item>
        <item>Setting \"Notification period\" in the main application settings allows you to select several separate periods for notification of an event. For example, you can set up receiving notifications for the week and day of the event.</item>

        <item><![CDATA[<br><img src="ic_event_birthday.webp" width=5% style="vertical-align:middle"> Birthday: During importing of event there is a search for a contact in the address book. Name recognition rules are used for this (by default uses calendar event title as contact name). If a contact is found, the person\'s data is used for event display. There are three options: <ol>
        <li>contact found, but there is already data about the birthday - the date from the calendar will be added to the event (with or without a year - depending on the setting)
        <li>the contact was found, but there is no information about the birthday - a new event will be added to the list
        <li>contact not found - a new event will be added
        </ol>]]></item>

        <item><![CDATA[<br>How to setup the display of events:<ol>
        <li>In the standard calendar application, create a calendar (or choose to display the calendar for national or religious holidays)

        <li>A link to instructions on how to upload friends\' birthdays from social networks is below
        <li>If in a birthday calendar event, the contact name occupies only part of the event name, you can define rules for name retrieval. This name will be used to search for contacts in the address book to add additional attributes: photo, organization, title, alias. Rules are configured in Settings-> Events customizing-> Birthday-> Rules. For example: calendar event title \"Birthday. John Doe\", rule: \"Birthday. [name]\" (without quotes)
        <li>After creating (enabling) calendars, you must select them in Settings-> Event customizing-> Birthday-> Calendars (Settings-> Event customizing-> Other event-> Calendars)
